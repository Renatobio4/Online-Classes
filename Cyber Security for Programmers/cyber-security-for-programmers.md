# Cyber Security for Programmers


## NUMBER ONE ENEMY!!!
... is you...

**Number Two...** are other employees...

Number Three... are floods...

Number 526 is... Zimbabawian Ninja Hackers...

## Disaster Recovery vs. Backups

Every minute your systems are down your company loses money.

## Welcome to Reality
>Stories:
>>If you can find the utility closet...
>
>>What do you mean you're in a flood plain, and you had me build your server room on the first floor???

### Employee Policies and Discipline Procedures
Create written policies for what employees are supposed to do.

Test managers to verify that they know the policies and will enforce them

Have a disciplinary policy for if employees violate rules

Know when to walk away...

>Story:
>Napster and the Sales Guy - Do you know how much he earns the company???

### Get Employee Buy In
Find non confrontational ways to get employees onboard with security policies

Train employees instead of scolding them
- Run lunch time seminars
- Create your own "certificate" program

### Don't Create More Problems
Understand the business your organization is in, and see yourself as a partner not as a seperate entity.

Running a company is hard.  You are one cog that the execs have to listen to.  Don't over estimate your value.

Someone else has to manage the security that you create.  A non bootable computer won't be hacked, but is also worthless.

"Shadow IT" is a credit card swipe away...

>3 ring binder of security infrastructure for a 2 person publishing company.

## Types of Threats

- Bad External Actors
  - Hackers
  - Dumb "Do Gooders" - Python module that wiped "Russian" servers
  - Hacktivists 
- Bad Internal Actors
  - Ransome
  - Job Security - Arrays so complicated no one can understand them
- Dumb People
  - Fat Finger of Death - Deleted wrong server...
  - Pulling the wrong cable
- Disasters
  - Apparently "biblical" floods are a thing...
- Bad Code
  - 'nuff said...
- Bad Hardware
  - How long does it take to ship in a motherboard?
  - Crappy Storage - Mirrored Drives replicated sector faults


## Requirements for an Attack
>I should be able to hand you the Gloabal Admin Username and Password

**Vector**

**Opportunity**

**Attack**

## Physical and Operational Security
>Put an "Out or Order" bathroom sign on your server room door...

**Physical Security**
- Locks - Keep good people from being dumb
- Doors -
- Server Racks and Cabinents - 
- 

**Operational Security**
  - Need to Know - Can the secretary lead a hacker to the server room?
  >Story - Stealing PBX Cards
  - Is Your Physical Layout Easy to Understand?
  - Admittance Policies

## Layered Security

Security is not a single product or setting.  It's numerous layers of protection so that if one fails you are still protected.

## Is the Cloud Secure?


# Tools

## Patch Management

## Layered Networks

## Antivirus

## SaaS

## Multifactor Authentication

## Geo Blocking

## Firewalls

## Permissions

## API Key Rotation

## Virtualization / Containerization
  The more features a device has the more vulnerabilities it has
  
  We used to load servers up with features because they were so expensive.  A Windows Small Business Server with AD, File Sharing, VPN, Exchange, Share Point, etc made sense when each "instance" of an OS would cost thousands of dollars.  
  
  Now each one of those services can be in it's own Virtual Instance or even it's own box for a very low cost.
